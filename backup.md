# hackerman14 Discord Bot

A Discord bot that tries to bring "quality" content to your Discord server, ahh well hope you enjoyed it. :/

## About
In September 2019, in my Discord server had some custom response setup with Dyno bot, and someone asked that why does it respond with Dyno instead of my bot, so I coded one. At first I'd just want a server bot, but now I decided to make it for everyone.

## Troubleshooting
